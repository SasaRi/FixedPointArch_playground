     * why ? res = x * 2^Q * y * 2^Q = x * y * 2^Q * 2^Q -> have to divide by 2^Q if to stay in Q format
     *
     * easiest way is to leave one number with 0 fractional bits, i.e result has the same number
     * of fractional bits as first operand
     * result is not divided by 2^Q_FORMAT
     * why ? res = x * 2^Q * y = x * y * 2^Q -> already in Q format
     *
     * multiplication result is always stored in a type with twice many bits as input variable
     * main problem with a multiplication is that result variable has to have enough integer bits
     * so overflow doesn't occur (that result isn't bigger than max.number of resulting type)
     * if overflow can happen, solution is to use numbers with less precision and more integer bits, i.e.
     * smaller Q format
     *
     * result is than casted back to previous type with dividing by 2^Q_FORMAT
